## What is kalman filter? 

The basic concept behind this algorithm is that we smoothe out a process by extracting its hidden state from the current state.
It adapts to new information as it arrives, so ...?

## Pros and cons

Pros : 
1. It works in non-stationary data because of its dynamically changing distirbutional characteristics. 

Cons :
1. It cannot work well in a non-linear system.
